Isolator:
	- get off CTGradient, move to NSGradient
	- kill LoginItemsAE.(hc)
	- properly link in Sparkle @done(2011-01-17)
		- remove deprecated callbacks and calls
	- zero warnings
	- build against x86_64
	- deprecate 10.5 or properly ifdef stuff in setFlagsAppropriately
		- need to make sure we use new Spaces API for 10.6 and GREATER
